# Champions Of The Forest
Turns a survival horror game "The Forest" into a RPG.
This was an attempt at creating a modification with models, sounds and HD textures.



### List of handy things:
[ResourceLoader.cs](https://github.com/Hazardu/ChampionsOfForest/blob/master/Res/ResourceLoader.cs) contains runtime loading of
-  .obj files
-  HD images, that modapi libraries does not support.
-  audio
-  assetbundles


[Networking](https://github.com/Hazardu/ChampionsOfForest/tree/master/Network) manages sending data between clients, with an option to select specyfic users to whom send a command.
- This could be upgraded by changing the sent type from string to a byte array.


RPG inventory system
- [inventory](https://github.com/Hazardu/ChampionsOfForest/blob/master/Player/Inventory.cs)
- [items and their stats](https://github.com/Hazardu/ChampionsOfForest/tree/master/Items)
